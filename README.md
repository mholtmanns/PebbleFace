# PebbleFace
Homemade Pebble Watchface like a German railway clock.

Actually the original design is from Swiss trainstation clocks and
the manufacturer keeps a closed license on the design. For more detail
see [their page on it](https://www.mondaine.com/watches/official-swiss-railways-watch.html).
So if you use this you do this on your own risk, I do not support this and
I myself do not use this in any other capacity than as an experimental
personal trial, not for commercial use or for any other form of distribution.

That said, my design is closer to German clocks as it has the pointer extension
in the seconds hand (if enabled) and the day of the month in place of the DB logo.
Additionally the current battery charge can be displayed at the bottom as a
differently colored strip.

This Watchface is for Pebble Time and Time Round only.
